Revision history for Perl extension Path::Router

    - Fix matching on variable path components with a path where the variable
      part evaluated to false (for instance, matching '/blog/show/:id' against
      '/blog/show/0'). Reported by Clay Fouts (RT#78388). (doy)

    - *POSSIBLE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY*
      When using uri_for, a match is considered more exact if it is also
      missing items from the path descriptor that don't appear in the route's
      defaults or variables. For instance, if a router has /foo with defaults
      of { 'a' => 'b' } and /bar with defaults of { 'a' => 'b', 'c' => 'd' },
      then ->uri_for({ 'a' => 'b' }) will always return /foo. Previously, it
      would return one of them arbitrarily, depending on the definition order.
      Also, if this new rule doesn't result in a single route being matched
      (for instance, if /foo had defaults of { 'a' => 'b', 'e' => 'f' }), then
      an exception will be thrown.
    - *POSSIBLE BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY*
      When using match, a path will be considered more exact if it matches more
      required non-variable path components. For instance, if a router has
      /foo/bar and /foo/:bar, then ->match('/foo/bar') will always match
      /foo/bar (and not /foo/:bar). Previously, it would return one of them
      arbitrarily, depending on the definition order. Also, if this new rule
      doesn't result in a single route being matched (for instance, if the
      router contained /:foo/bar and /foo/:bar), then an exception will be
      thrown.
    - Warn when creating validations that don't correspond to a path element
    - Convert to Dist::Zilla

0.10 Wed. Jan. 12, 2011
    * Path::Router
      - route_class attribute, to allow easy subclassing
        (thanks to Dylan Hardison)

0.09 Thurs. Dec. 10, 2009
    * Path::Router
      - fixing a minor problem with the path
        generator and optional parts

0.08 Tues. Dec. 8, 2009
    * Path::Router
      - added the include_router method
        to allow inclusion of other routers
        - added tests and docs for this

0.07 Tues. Mar. 10, 2009
    * Path::Router::*
      - lots of code re-written by Daisuke Maki
        resulting in an 150% speed increase
        - matching code is now inlined by default
          but inlining can be turned off if needed
    * Path::Router
      - added insert_route to allow more fine grained
        control over route ordering (Daisuke Maki)
    * tests
      - do not run pod tests unless testing a release

0.06 Sat. January 10, 2009
    * Path::Router
      - fix bug with >1 optional path component
      - simplify and completely redo uri_for matching

0.05 Sat. January 3, 2009
    * Path::Router
      - refinements to match correctly in more uri_for edge cases
    * Test::Path::Router
      - minor display improvements

0.04 Fri. January 2, 2009
    * Path::Router
      - fix uri_for to return undef on match failure instead of ''
        (empty string)

0.03 Wed. July 16, 2008
    * Path::Router::Shell
      - fixed spelling of Term::ReadLine (RT #37693)

0.02 Mon. July 14, 2008
    * Path::Router
      - changed DEBUG from a constant sub to $DEBUG
        a package variable. This is a new module and
        so easy debugability is important.

    * Path::Router::Route
      - silly fix to make sure exact paths will match
        - added tests for this

0.01 Sat. July 12, 2008
    - copied Ruby on Rails Router, but make it
      ... better, stronger, faster
